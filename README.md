# PlatformCollaboration
PlatformColab, a collaboration API used for managing, groups, teams, and small businesses. 

Sure, here's a README for your API:

# Business, Group and Team Management API

This API provides functionality for managing Businesses and Teams, including creating, deleting, joining, sending messages, managing members, and more. It is built using Django and the Django Rest Framework.
I've created a README that summarizes the request bodies for sending data to the API endpoints you provided. This README is simplified to include just the request body information:
